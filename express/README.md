## The Angular Test App

The test app is actually something I've always wanted to have, and perhaps exists in the wild somewhere, though I'm looking to create the simplest form possible.

Right now there is a working Simple Chat app, if you go to localhost:3000/room/[ room key ] your messages will only be broadcast to other people connected to that room.  Basically a really simple IRC without any of the other cool stuff.
